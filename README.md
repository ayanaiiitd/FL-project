# Heterogeneous Federated Learning- A Demo
This research explores the application of FL to the MNIST dataset, focusing on comparative
analysis under IID and non-IID data settings. The study involves two clients collaboratively
training a machine learning model using the FedAvg algorithm, with the aim of preserving data
privacy and decentralization. We systematically analyze the behavior of the clients by varying
the number of training epochs and evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy under different data distribu-
tions. By comparing IID and non-IID scenarios, we investigate how the heterogeneity of data
impacts model convergence and performance consistency across clients. This work emphasizes
the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of federated learning. The findings offer insights into the
trade-offs between communication efficiency, accuracy, and data distribution in FL applications.
